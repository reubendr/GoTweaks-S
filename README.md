```powershell
Set-ExecutionPolicy -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -Scope Process
.\Install.ps1
```

### Option B: Manual Install

1. Install the `.cer` certificate → Local Machine → Trusted People
2. Install dependencies from `Dependencies\x64` folder
3. Double-click the `.msixbundle` to install

### Enable the Widget

1. Open Xbox Game Bar (`Win + G`)
2. Click the **Widgets** menu
3. Find and enable **"Gaming"**

### Enable Game Detection

Required for per-game profiles and AutoTDP:
